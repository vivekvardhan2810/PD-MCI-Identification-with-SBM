# PD-MCI-Identification-with-SBM
<p>When I was Searching About Parkinson's disease, I got to observe an Journal paper Titled <b>"An SBM-based machine learning model for identifying mild cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease"</b> Which was Published by <b>Jiahui Zhang, You Li, Yuyuan Gao, Jinlong Hu, Biao Huang, Siming Rong, Jianing Chen, Yuhu Zhang, Limin Wang, Shujun Feng, Lijuan Wang, Kun Nie.</b></p>
<p><b>Original Paper link</b>: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022510X20304147/">Parkinson's Disease</a></p>

<p> Then I Got an Idea to Write a code by reading journal and Make it simple.</p>
<p>Developing a machine learning model for identifying PD-MCI using SBM is a promising approach. Consider collecting a well-curated dataset with relevant features, such as surface-based morphometric data. Employ a suitable algorithm like SVM or deep learning architectures for classification. Regular validation and collaboration with healthcare professionals can enhance the model's accuracy and reliability.</p>
<p>Here, The code generates a synthetic dataset with SBM-like features and binary labels for PD-MCI, then trains a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict PD-MCI based on the features. </p>
<p>But, Got An Accuracy of <b>45.50%</b></p>
