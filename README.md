# PD-MCI-Identification-with-SBM
<p>When I was Searching About Parkinson's disease, I got to observe an Journal paper Titled "An SBM-based machine learning model for identifying mild cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease" Which was Published by Jiahui Zhang, You Li, Yuyuan Gao, Jinlong Hu, Biao Huang, Siming Rong, Jianing Chen, Yuhu Zhang, Limin Wang, Shujun Feng, Lijuan Wang, Kun Nie.</p>
<p><b>Original Paper link</b>: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022510X20304147/">Parkinson's Disease</a></p>

<p> Then I Got an Idea to Write a code by reading journal and Make it simple.</p>
<p>Here,The code generates a synthetic dataset with SBM-like features and binary labels for PD-MCI, then trains a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict PD-MCI based on the features. </p>
